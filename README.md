ONLY includes:

  -All of parts 1 & 2.
  -Backend follow-along work from part 3 (exercises are separate).

This repo is to store the various smallscale projects and work, notes, etc., in my use of the earlier portions of the FullStack Open course, used in my preparation for Launch School's Capstone program.
