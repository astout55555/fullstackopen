ONLY includes:

  -Most of parts 1 & 2. (Notes project moved to part 3 stuff after modifications; frontend phonebook app from part 2 moved out of repo to the separate part 3 exercises repo.)
  -Backend follow-along work from part 3 (exercises are separate).

This repo is to store the various smallscale projects and work, notes, etc., in my use of the earlier portions of the FullStack Open course, used in my preparation for Launch School's Capstone program.
